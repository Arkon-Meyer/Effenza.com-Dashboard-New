# Project Documentation

## Security & Compliance

We maintain a living checklist for security, GDPR compliance, and future ISO 27001 readiness in:

[`docs/security/SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_TODO.md`](security/SECURITY_COMPLIANCE_TODO.md)

This document should be updated regularly as part of our development process to ensure:
- Alignment with GDPR and privacy best practices
- Implementation of encryption, access control, and logging
- Clear roadmap toward ISO 27001 certification
